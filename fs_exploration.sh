sudo apt update # Update the local package index to reflect the latest versions available in the repositories.
sudo apt upgrade # Install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system.
sudo apt install parted # Download and install the 'parted' utility for manipulating disk partitions.
Dependency Hell # A situation where the conflicting requirements of different software packages make it difficult or impossible to install or update them. his happens when Program A needs Version 1 of a library, but Program B needs Version 2 of that same library. You can't have both, so the system gets stuck.
sudo parted -l && echo -e "\n---\n" && lsblk -f && echo -e "\n---\n"
#sudo: Runs the command with root (administrator) privileges, which is required to read hardware partition tables.
#parted: Invokes the GNU Parted partition manipulation program.
#-l (list): Tells the program to list the partition layouts for all block devices (hard drives, SSDs, USBs) it can find. It shows the model, size, partition table type (MBR/GPT), and individual partitions.
#AND (&&): This ensures the next command only runs if the previous one finished successfully (without errors).
#echo -e "\n---\n"
#echo: Prints text to the terminal.
#-e: Enables the interpretation of backslash escapes.
#\n---\n: Prints a newline, a dashed line separator, and another newline to visually separate the outputs of the two main commands.
#lsblk -f
#lsblk: List Block Devices. It displays a tree-like structure of your disks.
#-f (filesystems): Adds specific info about filesystems. It shows what each partition is formatted as (ext4, fat32, ntfs), its UUID (unique ID), and where it is currently mounted in the system.
# Run the partition editor to list all disk layouts with admin rights, print a visual separator, and then display a tree view of all block devices including their filesystem types, UUIDs, and mount points.

# [ = starts a test (conditional).
# -d = checks if it is a directory.
# /sys/firmware/efi = Path to the system's EFI folder.
# ] = Close the test
#&& (Logical AND) = If the previous test is true (the directory exists), it executes the next command.
#echo "UEFI" = Prints "UEFI" to the terminal if the test passed.
#|| (Logical OR) = If the previous test was false (the directory does not exist), it executes the final command instead.
#echo "BIOS" = Prints "BIOS" to the terminal as a fallback.
# Check if the EFI firmware directory exists; if it does, print 'UEFI', otherwise print 'BIOS'
